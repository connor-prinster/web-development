# Move/Rotate To Point Demo
The sample must be run as a server: `node server.js`
With the server running, connect to: `http://localhost:3000`

Use the mouse to select a point (mouse click) the spaceship should travel to.  The ship will then begin turning and moving to the selected point.  It is possible to make the ship move in a circle by selecting a point just to the side, at a location tighter than it can trun.
